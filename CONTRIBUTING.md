# Contributing to Typerio ⌨️

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Typerio. Seriously, I wouldn't expect anyone to get such weird idea and I will be glad to git merge your branch!❤️

## Getting started 🛫

To start contributing, you need to clone the repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tuezeber/typerio-xyz.git
```

Once you have a local copy of the project, you can create a new branch to work on. To do this, you can use the following command:

```console
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a name that is descriptive of the changes you plan to make.

## Code changes 🧑‍💻

When making changes, please follow these guidelines:

- Use standard JavaScript naming practices such as camelCase.
- Try to use functions and avoid mutability (prefer `const` over `let`).
- The code should be self-documenting, but comments are also welcome.
- Prettier is required with the default configuration.
- For CSS classes, the plugin prefixes all internal classes with "typerio-", e.g., "typerio-black".
- Avoid bumping version.

## Submitting changes 📩

Once you've made your changes, you can submit a pull request. To do this, push your changes to your branch on GitHub, and then create a new pull request from your branch to the main Typerio repository.

Please provide detailed information when submitting your changes. Describe what you've changed and why.

## Reporting bugs 🪲

If you find a bug, please report it via GitHub issues of this repository. We appreciate your help in identifying bugs and issues.

Thank you again for your contribution!🚀
